- The Napkin Problem: can you, and if so, how much bigger?
	- Exploration: try to solve it for a bit
	- report back?
- Answer: Yes, \infty!
- Let's detour to Hilbert Curves
	- Def'n of curve
	- Define Hilbert H_n
	- Exploration: draw & conjecture about the length of H_n
	- Prove l(H_n) = 2^n-1/2^n
	- We can find a hilbert curve longer than any length
	- Continuing this process forever yields H, a space-filling curve, yay!
		Length & Area are different! Look at DIMENSIONS!! WUUUUUUUT
-Using Hilbert Curves to solve napkin problem
	- Define a "recursive" crease pattern
	- Show that we can draw the perimeter on the nth crease pattern in a way that ~covers the nth hilbert curve
	- $$940F17$$
